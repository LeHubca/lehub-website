> The Climate Justice Organizing Hub is a support structure designed around the needs of grassroots climate justice organizers that respects organizers’ knowledge regarding their own challenges and priorities. Through responsive troubleshooting, skills and strategy sharing, and other capacity-building activities, its mission is to help organizers find their way to building a critical mass of engaged people who are working towards a just transition.

Here are some concrete ways that the Hub will operate to serve its mission.

## 1. Group 'first aid' and gap-filling hub

Climate justice organizers are at the center of this, guiding us with their challenges, pain points and strategic questions. In response to their expressed needs, resource people and movement-aware specialists will be engaged by the Hub to work directly with organizers to try and work through issues that are holding back capacity and movement-building progress.

## 2. Community of practice for organizers/mobilizers and supporting organizations

This Hub intends to support the creation of virtual (and eventually real convening) spaces to bring organizers and those working in movement-generous supporting organizations together to share field experience and work on common challenges. The Hub would also engage guest visits from leading organizers in other countries (ex. Sunrise Movement folks) and also bring in some veteran organizers to speak to the long game of building power from other historical social movements including feminist activism, LGBTQ2S+ rights and Indigenous justice movements such as Land Back.

## 3. Organizing knowledge hub

Climate justice organizers are at the center of this, guiding us with their challenges, pain points and strategic questions. In response to their expressed needs, a Hub ‘librarian’ will assemble a body of learning on best practices in climate justice /progressive organizing and mobilizing strategy drawing from field experience of campaigners from around the world as well as leading researchers in this space.

## Funding and governance:

Full funding for the Hub is provided by the [Trottier Family Foundation](https://www.trottierfoundation.com/). The Hub is formally a project of the [Small Change Fund](https://www.smallchangefund.ca/), an Ontario-based charity organization.

The Hub’s Founding Director is Tom Liacas and Naomi Goldberg is the Hub Coordinator. The Hub’s Vision Team includes Amara Possian and Rim Mohsen.

The Hub will soon convene a Movement Council that will include representatives from grassroots climate justice organizations, NGOs that do movement support and also groups that represent intersectional struggles within the broader climate justice frame.

## Vision + Theory of Change

The world we want - In broad strokes:

A world where our societies operate in respect of the resource limits of the earth and support the survival of all forms of life. Where no population extracts and consumes an inordinate amount at the expense of others and one where all people, wherever they live, are protected from the effects of climate change and resource depletion.

A world of fair, inclusive and caring societies, where white supremacy and patriarchy are things of the past and where people can live free from colonialism, exploitation and inequality, in all of its forms.

## TOC

To make Climate Justice a priority, we need sweeping changes to current systems — cultural, political and economic — and we need them quickly, because time is running out.

For such big change to happen, social science tells us we need the active, engaged and sustained participation of over one million people across Canada.

Thankfully, a new generation of grassroots and decentralized organizers is building the networks we will need. This work is draining, however, and these organizers will need help to sustain themselves and the movements they are building.

The Climate Justice Organizing Hub aims to become a stable, nurturing and generative network that supports decentralized organizing and ensures the sustainability of grassroots movements by addressing organizers' first-order challenges and offering strategic and material resources to support their work.

Grassroots climate justice organizers already have the vision and the energy. With stable and ongoing support, we believe they can get the job done.
