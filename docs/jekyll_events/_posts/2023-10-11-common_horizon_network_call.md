In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought our daily routines to an abrupt halt, a small team of young organizers from across the country came together in a deliberate strategy process called “frontloading” to build a new social movement organization to tackle climate change and economic inequality in Canada.

Frontloading is a planning process that creates DNA, a set of genetic instructions that tells a movement how to grow. Movements are living organisms, which means they require strong DNA to be powerful in the world.

Hailing from Stellat'en First Nation to Sherbrooke, Québec, and coming from many different movement backgrounds— climate, electoral, Indigenous rights, economic, and migrant justice— the team was united by a deep belief in mass movements and everyday people’s capacity to build them.

Common Horizon | Horizon commun (CHC) is the ever-evolving product of this work. And while it may have been incubated by a small group of people, CHC will be brought to life by thousands more. Come find out more about the process of frontloading, the results of our work, and our plan to build a mass movement of everyday people to take power away from the billionaire class and win solutions to the climate crisis that secure good work, address affordability and ensure a dignified life for all.
