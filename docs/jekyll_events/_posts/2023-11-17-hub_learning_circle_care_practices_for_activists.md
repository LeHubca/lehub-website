Are you an activist who wants to learn from other activists about how they foster relationships and practices of care in their organizing and activism? 

Are you looking for inspiration or support in implementing new care practices into your grassroots group? Or perhaps your group already does excellent care work and you want to share your magic with others? 

[Join us for this discussion-based, guided learning circle](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZErcO-prDkoHtYPooHSA_j-_D5H5JE9DaGQ) on how to integrate better practices of care into your organizing relationships, groups and spaces. You'll leave with new ideas and practices about how best to weave meaningful practices of care into your social change work.
