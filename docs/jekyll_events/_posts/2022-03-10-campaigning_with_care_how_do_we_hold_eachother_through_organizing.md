\
At our January 25 community care check-in, many of you spoke openly about the challenges and roadblocks of these past years organizing during a pandemic. We talked about how relationships are at the core of organizing and how we must be grounded in the community if we want to build power for transformative change. With these themes still fresh in our minds, we wanted to follow up with a discussion on concrete practices to incorporate collective well-being and community care into our campaign processes.\
\
With momentum picking back up in the climate justice movement, how are we incorporating collective care into our group structures and strategies? We hope to hold space for us all to hone our care toolkits together.\
