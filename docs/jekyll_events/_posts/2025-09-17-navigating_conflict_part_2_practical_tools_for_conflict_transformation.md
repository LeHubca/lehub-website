When conflict comes up (not if, but when), how do we transform it? How can we understand and address the underlying needs that conflict surfaces? How do we repair? In the second part of our two-part conflict series, we will explore what solid conflict infrastructure can look like, as well as what practical tools can help us to approach conflict generatively.

*Please note that this workshop will not specifically cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to violence or abuse.*
