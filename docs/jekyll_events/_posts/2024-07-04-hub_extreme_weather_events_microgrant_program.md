Do you have an idea for a mutual aid project or grassroots action this summer connected with extreme weather events? Want to build stronger networks of mutual support, turn up the heat on the fossil fuel industry and build a stronger climate justice movement? The HUB is excited to announce we have some NEW resources for you! 

Starting today, we are accepting applications to the HUB’s NEW mutual aid and/or grassroots action microgrant program! We have a toolkit of ideas and resources for how to build a meaningful mutual aid and/or grassroots action in your community, as well as on-call coaching support to help you make your idea a reality.

Let’s support our communities through mutual aid and use grassroots action to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for worsening extreme weather events!
