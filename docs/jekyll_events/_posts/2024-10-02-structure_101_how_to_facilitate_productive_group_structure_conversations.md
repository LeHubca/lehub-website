Structure 101: How to facilitate productive group structure conversations

The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help you establish a group structure that lines up with your group's purpose and Theory of Change. In this workshop, we cover the inherent tensions between most grassroots groups’ rejection of hierarchy and the need for a functional and visible decision-making flow that keeps things moving and helps avoid group burnout.
