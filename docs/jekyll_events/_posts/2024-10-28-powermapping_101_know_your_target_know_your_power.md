When you're running a grassroots campaign, you're always going to be taking on something bigger than you are. So, how do you identify and get real about the power of your primary and/or secondary targets? And how should your group take stock of what resources you have to counter them? 

This workshop is all about how to undertake a powermapping process that will help your group identify a promising and vulnerable campaign target that you can move. We will also discuss how to take stock of your group’s assets so that you can apply the resources you can realistically access towards finding and exploiting your target's pressure points.
