Come join us on Wednesday, March 16 for a solidarity circle organized by the HUB in partnership with Research for the Front Lines! 

Waba Moko (Shannon Chief) will present the Anishnabe-led Moose Moratorium research project in conversation with Dr. Jen Gobby. Participants will have the chance to ask questions and explore how to get plugged into this research project with Research for the Front Lines, an initiative that connects grassroots and frontline activists with researchers who have skills, time and labour to offer. 

Research for the Frontlines is partnering with The Anishnabe Moose Research Committee on a study of moose populations in and around La Vérendyre Wildlife Park on the unceded territory of the Algonquin people. The goal of this project is to protect the moose which are essential to Algonquin culture and ways of life. Using ‘Two-Eyed Seeing’ as a guiding framework, researchers will gather information needed to help the Algonquin people fight for their rights to take care of the moose and the land and to manage the impacts that threaten the moose’s existence – including logging and mining in the territory, climate change, disease and pests. 

This is an opportunity for the climate justice community to explore this issue with Waba Moko (Shannon Chief) and learn about how to show up as allies. Come listen and learn about what skills can be contributed to the research! We will also discuss how to amplify this campaign once the research is complete. 

You can also support the project with donations [here](https://smallchangefund.ca/project/help-support-algonquin-led-research-to-protect-moose-populations-on-the-unceded-traditional-territory-of-the-algonquin-people/)
