<!--StartFragment-->

Activism, like any other form of labour, can be emotionally draining. With the current wave of COVID-19 triggering the largest pandemic-related crisis yet, on top of many other crises that already existed before that. The Mental Health and Capacity Check-In is a guided discussion to help navigate through these emotions. Informed by the requests of the HUB community, this session will hold space for climate activists to share feelings around burnout and isolation induced by this latest shutdown. This hour and a half session will be guided by Nmesoma Nweze.

This event is free for all climate justice activists across so-called Canada.

Nmesoma Nweze is currently a PhD student in McGill’s Clinical Psychology program. She holds an honours bachelor degree in neuroscience and psychology from the University of Toronto. Her passions and research interests are community psychology, particularly how relationships within Indigenous frameworks can be a vehicle for healing on an individual level and social change on the collective level. She was raised in Iqaluit, Nunavut, where she was introduced to environmental issues through the lenses of Inuit sovereignty and self-governance and culture. Later she engaged with environmental activists through protests and events during her time in Tkoronto. She greatly appreciates the opportunity to help facilitate a space for organizers and activists to be vulnerable, heard, understood, and hopefully come away with their cups refilled.
