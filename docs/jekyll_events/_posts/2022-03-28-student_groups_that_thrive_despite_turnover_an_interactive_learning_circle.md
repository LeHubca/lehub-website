!["RUNNING STUDENT GROUPS THAT NAVIGATE TURNOVER WITH EASE AN INTERACTIVE LEARNING CIRCLE!" in a sans serif, mint font on a lilac background.](/media/4.png)

Student groups are constantly dealing with turnover for obvious reasons. When several active members graduate at the same time, groups lose a lot of their capacity and membership. There are a number of student and other activist groups facing this and still building groups that thrive. If you want to learn from these experiences or share your own, please join us in this learning circle!

 As a group, we'll discuss ... 

\- Strategies that are used to ensure knowledge-transfer and whether they're effective or not

\- Avoiding situations where the burden of labour is always on oldest members

\- Avoiding group breakdown when member turnover happens every semester/year & more!

Join us on April 26th at 7 p.m. EDT!
