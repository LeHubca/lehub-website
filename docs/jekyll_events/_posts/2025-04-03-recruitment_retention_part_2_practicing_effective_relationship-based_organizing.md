Growing our movements to win requires effective recruitment and retention strategies. Building on theories and frameworks explored in part one, part two of this two-part workshop puts participants in the driver's seat and offers an opportunity to practice relationship-building skills that can be applied in varied campaign contexts. Participants will also leave with practical tools that can be explored in more detail with their campaign teams.
