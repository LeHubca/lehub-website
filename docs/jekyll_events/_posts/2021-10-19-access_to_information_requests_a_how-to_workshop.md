With Kevin Walby, author of the book *Access to Information and Social Justice: Critical Research Strategies for Journalists, Scholars, and Activists*

“Access to Information” requests can be a powerful way to hold governments and industry accountable as we fight for justice, rights, and a healthy environment. Decisions made by politicians, bureaucrats, police officers and company executives can have profound impacts on our lives. Often, this knowledge differs greatly from what we find on government websites or in politicians’ speeches, and accessing it can be difficult. Arming ourselves with the tools to gather information from Canada’s institutions and public agencies can make a huge difference in our movements for healthy, autonomous communities.In this workshop, University of Winnipeg professor Kevin Walbywill discuss:

> \-       What questions can be answered by “Access to Information” (ATI) or “Freedom of Information” (FOI) requests
>
> \-       Which government departments and agencies to target
>
> \-       How to write and submit ATI/FOI requests
>
> \-       How to ensure that government agencies follow through on our requests
>
> \-       How to interpret and mobilize the results of a request

Research for the Front Lines (RfFL) is an interdisciplinary team of researchers, activists and land defenders focused on serving communities experiencing social and environmental [justice issues. ](<>)Our goal is to help communities gather, analyze and communicate information critical to their struggles. We do this by connecting researchers with [community members ](<>)to produce collaborative, community-driven research.
