Another perennial problem grassroots groups face is navigating and guarding against high levels of turnover. How do we weave sustainable retention practices into our organizing so that we effectively integrate and maintain connections with new and returning members? In this workshop, we'll explore 1) why you need a strong onboarding process for new members, 2) how to build + implement an onboarding process successfully, and 3) how to use a ladder of engagement to build your group's internal capacity, skills and commitment!

T﻿his workshop will be recorded and will be sent out after the live workshop concludes.
