Conflict is a skill and a team effort: instead of thinking in binary terms of me/us vs you/them, this workshop invites participants to think about conflict as us versus the conflict.\
\
In this way, this workshop will teach participants how to work in community with others to address problems collaboratively through the principles of transformative justice and other approaches to conflict so that participants can co-create a climate movement based in care and solidarity. Together, participants will explore the history and practices of transformative justice, learn how to map conflict, and brainstorm how to collaboratively define solutions to disagreement.\
\
​​Please note that this workshop will not cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to harm, violence or abuse. Further resources on accountability processes for these situations will be provided at the end of the workshop.
