There's Something in the Water - A film by Elliot Page and Ian Daniel

Based on Ingrid Waldon's book, There's Something in the Water is a documentary film directed by Elliot Page and Ian Daniel. The film explores the disproportionate effect of environmental damage on Black and First Nations communities in Nova Scotia, from the suburb of Shelburne, where the correlation between contaminated well water and high rates of cancer is glaring, to the SipekneêžŒkatik First Nation, which is fighting a gas company's plan to dump salt brine into the Shubenacadie River.
