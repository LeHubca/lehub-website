The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help them guide their groups towards establishing a group structure that lines up with the group's purpose and Theory of Change.\
\
In this workshop, we cover the inherent tensions between the rejection of hierarchyÂ in most grassroots groups and the need for a functional and visible decision-making flow that will keep things moving and also help avoid group burnout.
