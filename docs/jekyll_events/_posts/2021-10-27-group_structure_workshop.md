The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help them establish a group structure that lines up with their group's purpose and Theory of Change. In this workshop, participants will learn about the inherent tensions between democratic principles and structure, as well as how certain frameworks can lead to more sustainable groups.
