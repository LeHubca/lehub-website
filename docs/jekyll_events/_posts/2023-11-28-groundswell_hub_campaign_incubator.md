ABOUT THE WORKSHOP SERIES

The Groundswell HUB Campaign Incubator is a practical series of campaign-building workshops designed to support climate and social justice activists to contest power and win concrete change. Over the course of 7 weeks, you’ll learn how to integrate effective campaigning tools and instincts into your work so that you can design, deploy, and assess a strategic campaign strategy for maximum impact. 



This series of free, remote workshops will take place on Tuesdays starting February 6th and ending March 19th, 2024. Each training session lasts 90 minutes with weekly corresponding office hours where you can bring your specific challenges to the HUB team for hands-on troubleshooting support.

Since real campaigning wisdom is learned by doing, you’ll learn from a number of seasoned campaigners, including [Judy Rebick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrebick/?originalSubdomain=ca), [Umme Hoque](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ummesarahhoque/), [Mike Balkwill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-balkwill/?originalSubdomain=ca), and workshop co-facilitator [Tom Liacas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomliacas/?originalSubdomain=ca), who will share their personal insights on what specific skills and instincts they’ve had to discover and develop in order to build campaigns that create a real crisis for the status quo.

Whether you find yourself with just an idea for a campaign or are currently in the middle of one and unsure how to move forward, the Campaign Incubator will equip you with a set of practical skills and tools so you can build, deploy and troubleshoot your own plan for change.

Over 7 weeks, we will help you and your campaigning group:

* Identify and avoid the common pitfalls that lead many campaigns to fail
* Find pressure points that can move even the most powerful targets
* Create realistic strategies that line up with your group's resources and goals
* Develop agile planning habits and solid project management approaches
* Design, test and deploy a campaign strategy and assess effectiveness along the way
* Build relationships and coalitions at the rate and scale your campaign requires
