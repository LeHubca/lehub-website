As the climate crisis intensifies around the world, how is Canada showing up within the international community?

Join us for a webinar exploring the idea of "Fair Shares", a key component of climate justice that movements in the Global South have championed for decades. 

The climate crisis is driven by deep histories of colonialism, global capitalism, international trade, geopolitics and imperialism. All of these forces come together to create the political deadlock that we find ourselves in today. This crisis, however, also has a deep history of organized struggle, which began in the Global South where communities have been pushing back against the root causes of this crisis for decades. We need to understand this history and the current global big picture in order to truly understand "Climate Justice". With this international perspective in mind, we can do our local and regional work more effectively.

We are lucky to have two incredible speakers share their stories and analysis about what the the Fair Shares campaign is, why it matters, and how members of the Canadian climate movement can help:
