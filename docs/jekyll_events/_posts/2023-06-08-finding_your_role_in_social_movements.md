Are you new to social movement activism/organizing and not sure where to start? 

Or are you a seasoned organizer looking to reconnect to your purpose? 

It can be hard to figure out what actions + roles you can take on in the fight for climate and social justice. In order to build the critical mass necessary to pose a threat to the status quo, we’re going to need many people with a diverse set of experiences, skills and gifts to build the world we need. 

[Join us for an interactive workshop](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUpdeCspjsiH9SNZVYhh40L4SZaKxH6N_o6) (created in collaboration with SFPIRG) about the many roles that exist in making social change happen. Based on tools created by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (@ayanaeliza) and Deepa Iyer (@DeepaVIyer) including the Social Change Map and workbook, we will investigate together how we can show up with more integrity and authenticity in the movements that matter to us.
