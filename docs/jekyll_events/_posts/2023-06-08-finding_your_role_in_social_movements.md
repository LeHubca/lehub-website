Are you new to social movement activism/organizing and not sure where to start? 

Are you shifting roles and energies in social movement spaces and looking for guidance? 

It can be hard to figure out what actions + roles you can take on in the fight for climate and social justice. In order to build the critical mass necessary to pose a threat to the status quo, weâ€™re going to need many people with a diverse set of experiences, skills and gifts to build the world we need. 

[Join us on July 4th at 2:30pm PT/5:30pm ET for an online, interactive workshop](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcscuCqqzoiG9cpaIARXe_BDiqmy7C__LKS) in collaboration with SFPIRG about the many roles that exist in making social change happen. Based on tools created by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson (@ayanaeliza) and Deepa Iyer (@DeepaVIyer) including the Social Change Map and workbook, we will be investigating together how we can show up with more integrity and authenticity in the movements that matter to us. 

[This workshop](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcscuCqqzoiG9cpaIARXe_BDiqmy7C__LKS) was originally created by SFPIRG and will be co-facilitated by SFPIRG and the HUB.
