This month, try something different with us! Instead of inviting you to attend a workshop, we invite you to take a pause and do an activity you enjoy alongside climate activists and organizers from across Canada over Zoom. Consider it an act of radical self and community careâ€”a disruption to the expectation that we must always DO more and BE more. 

How will it work? [Hop on the Zoom call at 6pm MT/8pm ET](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIsf-6prTsvEtEZWq_4SZqyB-aOuf_ZGqvp) with a craft or activity of your choice: maybe you want to use this time to do some cooking, crocheting, colouring, drawing, writing, you name it! Once on the call, you will have a choice of two rooms to join: one room will have a facilitator sparking casual conversation and helping people make new connections! The second room will be a quiet room where participants are encouraged to work on their craft or activity while gentle music plays in the background. At the end of the 1 hour session, participants will have the opportunity to share what they have been working on with the group (but only if you want to!).

We hope our [Fill Up Your Cup event](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIsf-6prTsvEtEZWq_4SZqyB-aOuf_ZGqvp) will inspire you to make more time in your daily life for activities that bring you joy!
