How do you approach conflict? More often than not, we struggle to handle conflict because we have not been taught how to navigate differing needs and perspectives with respect, compassion and curiosity. When done right, conflict can be an opportunity for connection and deeper understanding.

In part one of this two part workshop series, participants will leave with a strong understanding of 1) how to avoid preventable conflict by prioritizing care needs and 2) how to communicate through conflict by using the four principles of Nonviolent Communication. 

​​Please note that this workshop will not cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to harm, violence or abuse. Further resources on accountability processes for these situations will be provided at the end of the workshop.

[S﻿ign up here for this workshop on February 15th at 4pm PST/7pm EST.](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUrcemprDspGdSRhhkWadOZ0ox6Ux-1AXOs)
