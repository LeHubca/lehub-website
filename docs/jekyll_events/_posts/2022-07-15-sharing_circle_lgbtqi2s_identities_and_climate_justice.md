In an effort to decompartmentalize climate justice struggles, the HUB would like to open a space for discussion on LGBTQIA2S+ issues and their connections to the climate crisis.

We invite participants to share their thoughts, however embryonic. Here are some guiding questions, but we strongly encourage you to explore more if you feel like it:

\- In what ways can LGBTQIA2S+ identities be a factor of marginalization and vulnerability in times of climate crisis?

\- How can social struggles lead to a post-capitalism of queer liberation?

\- How can we destroy the binary and colonial conception of nature that is often at the root of oppression ?

\- What makes a group welcoming to LGBTQIA2S+ people ?

Of course, few satisfactory answers are likely to emerge without a broad intersectional analysis, taking into account all of the factors that give rise to deep inequalities among LGBTQIA2S+ people. We are committed to working to ensure that the space is as safe as possible so that each person feels comfortable sharing their lived experience. Safer-space keepers will be available throughout the event if anyone feels uncomfortable.

The discussion will be facilitated by Laura Doyle-PÃ©an and will take place on Zoom. Simultaneous translation will be available in English and French.
