So when conflict comes arrives (not if, but when), how do we transform it? 

How ought we approach conflict so that we understand and meet the underlying needs that conflict surfaces? How do we repair? 

Join us for this hands-on workshop, part 2 of our two-part series, which will help you set up the following in your personal and activist life: 1) conflict infrastructure you need to have; 2) tools, like conflict maps, which can help you approach conflict generatively. 

Sign up [here.](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYqd-itqD8qHtRiYaoeMBTQeM09uVFeDy79) 

\*Please note that this workshop will not cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to harm, violence or abuse.\*
