The climate movement has a lot to learn from the disability justice movement. Building off Care 101, we will touch concepts of eco-ableism, crip time, care webs, and spoon theory. Participants will also be introduced to a second set of strategies for building robust, caring, and anti-ableist spaces. There will be opportunities to share knowledge & work through care-related challenges you/your group are facing!
