How do you approach conflict? More often than not, we struggle to handle conflict because we have not been taught how to navigate differing needs and perspectives with curiosity and respect. When done right, conflict can be an opportunity for growth, connection, and deeper understanding. In part one of this two part workshop series, participants will leave with an understanding of what principles to put in place in order to prevent destructive conflict and lay the groundwork for generative conflict.

Make sure to also sign up for Part 2: Practical Tools for Conflict Transformation!

*Please note that this workshop will not specifically cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to violence or abuse.*
