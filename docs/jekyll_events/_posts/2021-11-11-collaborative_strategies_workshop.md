The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with frameworks and decision-making tools that help guide groups collaboratively towards creating solid strategies. This is not just a primer on the principles of solid strategy (though it does cover that) but mostly a session for group facilitators that helps them guide their own groups towards finding a balance between the desire for collaborative decision making with the need to focus and narrow down to create solid strategy.
