The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with frameworks and decision-making tools that help guide groups collaboratively towards creating solid strategies.\
\
This is not just a primer on the principles of solid strategy but also a session that helps participants find a balance between the desire for a collaborative, democratic decision making process and the need to focus and narrow down to create successful strategy.
