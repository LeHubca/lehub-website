The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with foundational concepts and tools that help them develop and uphold anti-oppressive and intersectional environmentalist practices in their organizing work. Topics include environmentalism in the context of settler colonialism, why climate action must include social justice, and how to be an effective ally or accomplice in the climate movement.
