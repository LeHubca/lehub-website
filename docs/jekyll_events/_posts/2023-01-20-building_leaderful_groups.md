Activists often face a choice between taking on unsustainable amounts of work or letting a project die.\
\
In this workshop, co-hosted by Decolonial Solidarity, we'll look at the ways that activists can meet this challenge with leadership development.\
\
That is, working with participants to build self-confidence, skill, and deepening their connection to one another and the campaign.\
\
In this workshop, taking place on February 5th at 4pm PST/7pm EST, we'll explore the concept of leadership in activist spaces and reimagine together what leadership and leaderfulness ought to look like.\
\
This workshop will challenge the notion of leadership as a form of domination and instead replace it with an expansive idea of leadership as a role of service and accepting responsibility.\
\
We'll then look at practical skills activists can use to build their group's capacity by cultivating leaderfulness and taking part in leadership development.
