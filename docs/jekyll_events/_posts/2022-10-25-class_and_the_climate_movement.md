As the climate crisis intensifies, so do the disparities between corporations and working class people.\
\
As big oil continues to exploit both people and the planet in order to satisfy heightening profit motives, it is the most impoverished and precarious workers and their families (especially in the Global South) that increasingly bear the brunt of the climate crisis' disastrous impacts.\
\
During this virtual panel discussion on November 2nd, we ask: what role does the working class have in fighting the climate crisis? Why do we need a working-class-centered climate movement and how do we get there? What do working class people need from the climate movement in order to build meaningful solidarity together?\
\
Join us on Nov 2nd from 7-8:30pm EST for a bilingual round table event discussing the role and power of the working class in the climate movement.\
The round table discussion with panelists will be followed by a Q + A session.\
\
Simultaneous translation will be available in both EN and FR.
