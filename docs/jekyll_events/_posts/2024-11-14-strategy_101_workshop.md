The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with frameworks and decision-making tools that help guide groups collaboratively towards creating solid strategies. 

This interactive workshop is not just a primer on the principles of solid strategy, but also a session meant to help participants find a balance between the desire for a collaborative, democratic decision making process and the need to focus and narrow down to create successful strategic goals. 

This workshop was created because this topic has been requested often by climate justice organizers. The curriculum material was drawn from a collaboration between several senior movement thinkers including Amara Possian and Tom Liacas, and also draws on sources and wisdom from many other folks in the Momentum Training Community, Mobilisation Lab and Blueprints for Change.
