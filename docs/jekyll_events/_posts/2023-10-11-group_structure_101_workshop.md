The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help them guide their groups towards establishing a group structure that lines up with the group's purpose and Theory of Change. 

In this workshop, we cover the inherent tensions between the rejection of hierarchy in most grassroots groups and the need for a functional and visible decision-making flow that will keep things moving and also help avoid group burnout. This workshop was created because this topic was often requested by climate justice organizers. 

The curriculum material was drawn from a collaboration between several senior movement thinkers including Amara Possian and Tom Liacas, and also draws on sources and wisdom from many other folks in the Momentum Training Community, Mobilisation Lab and Blueprints for Change.
