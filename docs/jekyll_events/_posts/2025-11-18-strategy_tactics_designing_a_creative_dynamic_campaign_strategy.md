Coming up with a powerful campaign strategy and effective tactics can feel daunting, but there’s no need to get tied up in knots about it - strategizing can be a lot of fun too! In this interactive session, participants will learn some key principles needed to develop a dynamic grassroots strategy and ways to assess its effectiveness as it is deployed on the ground. You’ll hear interview clips from experienced movement elders and organizers and get some practice with developing a strategy and tactics for a hypothetical campaign scenario.
