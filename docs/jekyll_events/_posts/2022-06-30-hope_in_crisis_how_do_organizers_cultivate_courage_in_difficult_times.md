The HUB will be coming to you LIVE on Instagram on July 12th at 4pm PST/7pm EST!

Join Sara, the HUB's Anglophone Coordinator, in conversation with Gabrielle Gelderman (@theclimatechaplain), a climate justice organizer and community chaplain based in Treaty 6 territory in amiswaciwaskahikan / Edmonton.

In this conversation, Sara and Gabrielle will discuss how they practice hope and promote care in their organizing and personal lives. As the organizer Kelly Hayes says, "hope is often trivialized or overlooked rather than cultivated \[in social justice movements], despite the fact that people and movements are likely to collapse in its absence."

What would it mean to actively cultivate hope in our movement spaces? How can we, to paraphrase the organizer Mariame Kaba, make hope a discipline? Tune in on July 12th to join the conversation! 

This conversation will be recorded and accessible after the event.
