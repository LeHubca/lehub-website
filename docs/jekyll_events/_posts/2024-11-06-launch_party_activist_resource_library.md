Located in Tiohtià:ke | Montreal at the [Milton Parc Citizens' Committee](https://ccmp-mpcc.com/en/home/ "https\://ccmp-mpcc.com/en/home/"), the Activist Resource Library is a youth-led, youth-serving initiative that aims to support Montreal-based activists with their direct actions by providing access to community, meeting space, and a lending library where members can borrow advocacy resources such as megaphones, hi-vis vests, projectors, and more!\
\
We're excited to share the launch of this project with all of you on November 28th at Co-op Bar Milton Parc! If you're interested in learning more or connecting with others in the movement, we encourage you to reserve your FREE ticket asap! If that's not convincing enough, there will be dinner and light refreshments, free goodies, lots of great conversation, and more!
