Building on the basis of Structure 101, we'll explore together how to build a strong group structure that supports working groups, pods, or teams working collectively on different pieces of a joint project or campaign. Together, we will discuss principles that make for effective teams aligned on shared purpose and norms, and clear roles and explore how to integrate the snowflake model as a scalable approach to leaderful and impactful organizing.
