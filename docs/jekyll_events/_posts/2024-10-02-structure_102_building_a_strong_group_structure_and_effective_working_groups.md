Structure 102: building a strong group structure and effective working groups

Building on the basis of structure 101, we will explore together how to build a strong group structure that supports working groups or pods working on different issues. Together we will discuss how to integrate the snowflake model into your work and discuss the principles that make for effective working group teams aligned on collective norms and values.
