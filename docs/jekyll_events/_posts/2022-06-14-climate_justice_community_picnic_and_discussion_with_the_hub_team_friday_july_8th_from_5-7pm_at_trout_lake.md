Come join folks from the Climate Justice Organizing HUB in so-called Vancouver for a picnic and discussion at Trout Lake on Friday, July 8th! We'll be hanging out and hosting a discussion about where the climate justice movement is at now, how much more power needs to be built towards systems change, and how we can build that base together.

RSVP is required and you can do so here: [](tinyurl.com/2n73h5j3)<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTZLyJ55SUev8mHZWRaRR7oP7BmOdISI7XUJDC1T7JbJbfig/viewform>
