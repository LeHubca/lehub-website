🌱 Come join folks from the Climate Justice Organizing HUB ([lehub.ca](http://lehub.ca/)) in so-called Vancouver for a picnic and discussion at Trout Lake on Friday, July 8th!\
\
✊🏾 We'll be hanging out and hosting a discussion facilitated by HUB team members Jacqueline, Naomi, Michelle and Sameen, about where the climate justice movement is at now, how much more power needs to be built towards systems change, and how we can build that base together.\
\
🗣 This dialogue is intended as a drop of some big-picture movement ideas informed by research, personal organizing experience and historical perspectives, to help climate justice organizers think of where they’re at in the movement-building cycle.\
\
🧺 Picnic-style snacks and drinks will be provided.

RSVP is required and you can do so here: tinyurl.com/2n73h5j3.

\
This event will take place on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. As we acknowledge the lands on which we'll be gathering, we are compelled to consider how the climate justice community can leverage itself to foreground and support Indigenous-led environmental and climate solutions. When we discuss systems change, we're talking about the interlocking colonial, capitalist and heteropatriarchal systems that we are up against, and how the climate justice community must centre those who are pushed to the margins as we build a better world for all.\
