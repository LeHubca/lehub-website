Come join folks from the Climate Justice Organizing HUB in so-called Vancouver for a picnic and discussion at Trout Lake on Friday, July 8th! We'll be hanging out and hosting a discussion about where the climate justice movement is at now, how much more power needs to be built towards systems change, and how we can build that base together.

Picnic-style snacks and drinks will be provided.

RSVP is required and you can do so here: [tinyurl.com/2n73h5j3](tinyurl.com/2n73h5j3).
