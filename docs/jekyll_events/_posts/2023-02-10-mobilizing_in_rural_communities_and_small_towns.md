Activists and organizers based in rural areas and small cities face particular challenges that are unique from urban or larger city environments. 



Many organizers find themselves discouraged by limited turnout to their events compared to more populated areas, as well as other barriers to building community power. 



What skills and strategies can we leverage in rural communities in order to build a stronger climate justice movement? 



Join us at this learning circle to learn from fellow activists and organizers from coast to coast to coast about how to build strong organizing skills in smaller communities!
