Many grassroots groups struggle with attracting and empowering new people to join their ranks and help build the collective power necessary to achieve our climate justice goals. What does effective recruitment look like and how can you integrate these best practices into your climate + social justice organizing? Join us August 9th for an interactive workshop about how to 1) build a group people want to join, 2) use community mapping to find + reach out to new segments of the population, and 3) successfully activate new members and begin to integrate them into your team.
