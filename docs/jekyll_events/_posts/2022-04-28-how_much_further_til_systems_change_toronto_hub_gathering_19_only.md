Come join folks from the Climate Justice Organizing HUB (lehub.ca) in Toronto for snacks and drinks on the HUB at Bathurst Local on Thursday, May 12th. Please note that this event is 19+.

We'll be hanging out and hosting a discussion facilitated by Amara Possian and Tom Liacas about where the climate justice movement is at now, how much more power needs to be built towards systems change, and how we can build that base together.

This dialogue is intended as a drop of some big-picture movement ideas informed by research, personal organizing experience and historical perspectives, to help climate justice organizers think of where they’re at in the movement-building cycle.
