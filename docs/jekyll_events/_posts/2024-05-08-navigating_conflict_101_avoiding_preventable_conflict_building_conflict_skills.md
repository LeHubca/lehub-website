How do you approach conflict? 

More often than not, we struggle to handle conflict because we have not been taught how to navigate differing needs and perspectives with curousity and respect. When done right, conflict can be an opportunity for connection and deeper understanding. In part one of this two part workshop series, participants will leave with a strong understanding of what principles to put in place in order to prevent destructive conflict and how to prepare for the generative conflict we need in order to understand each other better. Make sure to also sign up for Part 2: Collaborative Conflict Resolution, taking place on May 29. ​​

\*Please note that this workshop will not cover how to navigate conflict that includes or escalates to harm, violence or abuse.\*
