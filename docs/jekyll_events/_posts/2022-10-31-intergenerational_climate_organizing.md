Environmental movements are fragmented along lines of age and generation. In order to work together constructively to demand bold action to tackle the climate crisis, we must practice listening to and learning from each other. This means learning from and working with people within and outside our own generation.\
\
Join us for an intergenerational dialogue to begin understanding and dissolving the boundaries that are holding us back from harnessing true intergenerational power

T﻿his event is a collaboration between Future Ground Network, Climate Reality Canada and the Climate Justice Organizing HUB.
