Stay tuned as the HUB launches a series of workshops and learning circles for climate/social justice organizers this fall! Topics to come include conflict management in groups, facilitating productive group structure and strategy sessions and anti-oppression resources for group learning. We're working hard to get all this prepped for mid-October.
