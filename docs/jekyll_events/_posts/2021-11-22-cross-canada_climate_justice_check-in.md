Through many conversations with organizers these past months, we've heard lots of folks express interest in deepening the connective tissue between climate justice (CJ) groups and campaigns across the country.

**To help with this, the Climate Justice Organizing HUB is convening thisÂ [cross-country virtual check-in call](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZcsdeytpzgrEtGooyJUUUx2vc_Y2NqWX3Wr?fbclid=IwAR0SIRHbnB16tIbodhiReRyMzFatnurIKT1NaZA7brhCzuxqBWNTTXQaIX8), bringing together CJ organizers from across the country.**Â 

With an interactive slide deck circulating before the event, we'll gather updates and check-in greetings from as many of you as possible. During the gathering, we will hearÂ from folks working on different campaigns and projects, which will be followed by breakout rooms wherein folks can discuss these with the organizers themselves.

**Featured projects and speakers will include:**

Â *ðŸŒ¿Â  Â Dr. Jen Gobby*, presenting Research for the Front Lines, a network of allied students and academics that provides research and writing support for frontline organizers.\
ðŸŒ¼Â *Guy Brodsky*, an organizerÂ with Divest Canada and Banking on a Better Future,Â presentingÂ the Banking on a Better Future campaign, a group of grassroots youth organizers from across so-called Canada focused on institutional fossil fuel divestment.\
ðŸŒ²Â *Isabelle Grondin Hernandez*, member of La CEVES, presentingÂ updates on discussions, reflections and plans for a general strike with the student movement\
ðŸŒºÂ *Naisha Khan and Aishwarya Puttur*, facilitating a BIPOC circle on the practices and resources needed forÂ BIPOC community care in the climate movement.Â
