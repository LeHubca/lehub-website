Date: Tuesday, June 18th, 4-5:30pm PT/7-8:30pm ET

Where: [Bilingual online event on Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMpd-2trDopHdR2kBP1M7_ETXICvSx0zeDC#/registration)

Last year’s wildfire season was the most destructive ever recorded in Canada. With another devastating wildfire season upon us and extreme weather events intensifying across the globe, fossil fuel CEO salaries are soaring and politicians are failing to hold them accountable. How do we as climate and social justice activists, united in our vision for a decolonized, decarbonized and just world, meet this moment?



In this bilingual online panel discussion, we ask: how can we help our communities connect the dots between the fossil fuel industry and intensifying extreme weather events in order to win climate justice action at the speed and scale we need? How can we best support Indigenous and settler communities in moments of extreme emergency through community-led mutual aid, as well as work to build the collective power necessary to leverage extreme weather events into catalysts for holding Big Oil accountable? And how can we best support ourselves and our fellow activists in moments of emergency and uncertainty by prioritizing practices of care in our work? 



In addition to this panel discussion, we’re excited to announce the launch of the HUB’s 



* Extreme Weather Mutual Aid and Grassroots Action Toolkit, co-produced by The Climate Reality Project Canada, and
* a microgrants program for mutual aid and actions taking place this summer!



The Extreme Weather Mutual Aid and Grassroots Action Toolkit is full of ideas, best practices and resources for new and seasoned activists looking to take care of their communities through mutual aid or who want to stage an action to turn up the heat on Big Oil. In tandem with the toolkit, the microgrants program is meant to offer financial resources to new and established groups looking to make their own mutual aid or action ideas a reality.
