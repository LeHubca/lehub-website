Groundswell, the HUB’s Campaign Workshop Series, is a series of campaign-building workshops designed to support climate and social justice activists as they contest power and win concrete change. Over the course of 6 weeks, you’ll learn how to integrate effective campaigning tools and instincts into your work so that you can design, deploy, and assess a campaign strategy for maximum impact. 

**This series of free, remote workshops will take place on Thursdays starting October 9th and ending November 13th, 2025.** Each training session lasts 90 minutes (4-5:30pm PT / 7-8:30pm ET). There will be a Q&A period after each session, where you will be able to ask questions and discuss your specific campaign with the HUB team.
