We will be speaking with Chris all about what it means to be doing Movement-led research. We will ask him questions all about 1) what it means to do research in service of movements 2) learning to relinquish control of the research question and methods and outputs and 3) how we can navigate the tensions between academic commitments and accountability to the movements or communities we are serving.

Come join us for important opportunity to learn about doing research that supports the fight for social and environmental justice.
