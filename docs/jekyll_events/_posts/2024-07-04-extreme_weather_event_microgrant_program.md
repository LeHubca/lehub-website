Do you have an idea for a mutual aid project or grassroots action this summer connected with extreme weather events? Want to build stronger networks of mutual support, turn up the heat on the fossil fuel industry and build a stronger climate justice movement? The HUB is excited to announce we have some NEW resources for you! 

Starting today, we are accepting applications to the HUB’s NEW mutual aid and/or grassroots action microgrant program! We have a toolkit of ideas and resources for how to build a meaningful mutual aid and/or grassroots action in your community, as well as on-call coaching support to help you make your idea a reality. 

Check out the link in our bio for a link to 1) our [Mutual Aid and Grassroots Action Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18dPytWqwbQQnv5nMRFRn97upGdDLt1dfxwXInf1vXb4/edit?usp=sharing) for project ideas, 2) an [overview of our new microgrant program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PxhtL90Bn-nMfQcVHXmH9NU-k29opKDn5LAjpq6fzO4/edit?usp=sharing), and 3) [the application](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/yMKJ6Hfvt0DW3i6UNIWl+91lB0K9M25Zcn2BnGgnutU/) to apply for grants between 500$ to 2000$ to bring your idea to life! Let’s support our communities through mutual aid and use grassroots action to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for worsening extreme weather events!
