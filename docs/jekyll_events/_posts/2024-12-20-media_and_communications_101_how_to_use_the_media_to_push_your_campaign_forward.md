How can organizers make effective use of traditional and social media to drive their work forward? This introductory workshop combines practical skills and tips with hands-on practice in crafting a compelling public narrative for media interviews. 

Participants will leave with the skills needed to prepare for and generate media coverage, bring campaign messages to new audiences, respond to challenging or adversarial media questions, and leverage the power of social media towards organizing goals.
