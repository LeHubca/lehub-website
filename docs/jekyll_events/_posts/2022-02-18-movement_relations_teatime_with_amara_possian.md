There is a wealth of organizing knowledge in every generation of activists, many lessons that don't end up being successfully passed down, allowing for similar mistakes to manifest and repeat. Many in the HUB community acknowledge this issue and aspire to break this cycle of lost activist knowledge. In response to these requests for knowledge sharing, we have asked Amara Possian to share her movement journey and experiences. Looking at the past decade, Amara will share some wins, lessons, and reflections on shifts in the climate justice movement, to shape our discussion about building the movement we need.\
