\*\*\*This event has been postponed. Updates on a new date will come soon.\*\*\*



There is a wealth of organizing knowledge in every generation of activists, many lessons that don't end up being successfully passed down, allowing for similar mistakes to manifest and repeat. Many in the HUB community acknowledge this issue and aspire to break this cycle of lost activist knowledge. In response to these requests for knowledge sharing, we have asked Amara Possian to share her movement journey and experiences. Looking at the past decade, Amara will share some wins, lessons, and reflections on shifts in the climate justice movement, to shape our discussion about building the movement we need.\
\
Amara (she/her) is a campaigner, educator, and facilitator who cut her teeth as an organizer in the youth climate movement. She has 10+ years of experience helping groups run winning campaigns and build thriving organizations, including Our Time, the youth-led campaign to put a Green New Deal front and centre during the 2019 election. An experienced designer and facilitator, Amara has trained and coached thousands of activists around the world. Sheâ€™s passionate about building political and grassroots leadership to tackle climate change, racism, and inequality. She currently manages Canada campaigns at 350.org and teaches campaigning at Seneca College in Toronto.
