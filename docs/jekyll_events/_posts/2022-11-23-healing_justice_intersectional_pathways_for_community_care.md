What does healing mean to you?\
\
How can we expand our repertoires of healing outside of the oppressive structures in which we live?\
\
In this workshop, facilitator Atreyu Lewis (he/them) teaches participants how to engage in practices of healing that challenge dominant colonial and capitalist systems.\
\
Weaving together intersectional environmentalism, disability justice, and teachings from Black and Indigenous approaches to justice and healing, this workshop equips participants with a strong understanding of intersectional healing justice principles and practices that go beyond hyper-individualism and wellness trends and embrace community and collective healing.

N﻿ew date for January 2023 coming up!

This workshop was produced by Atreyu Lewis and brought to you by the Climate Justice Organizing HUB. The HUB is a project of the Small Change Fund.
