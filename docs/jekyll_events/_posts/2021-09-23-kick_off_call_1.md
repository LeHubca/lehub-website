Coming soon: capacity building support for climate justice organizers in the ways you all asked!

The semester has started, election day is over and we're somewhat back in real space with one another. There's no doubt about it â€“ you are hitting the ground running.

Join the HUB team as we kick off what we've been cooking up for you: A support structure for the grassroots climate justice movement designed in collaboration with climate justice activists! Over the past year, we've had conversations with many of you about your main challenges and pain points, and what your groups need to move forward. We've heard recurring requests for support with...

![ðŸŒ¸](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t8f/2/16/1f338.png)Â figuring out solid grassroots group structure\
![ðŸŒº](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t38/2/16/1f33a.png)Â holding space for conflict and learning about transformative justice\
![ðŸŒ»](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tb9/2/16/1f33b.png)deepening our praxis of anti-oppressionâ€“ and more.

Now, it's time for us to share what we've been working on and to continue to learn from you about what we should build next.

We've got workshops on the above topics lined up for you, as well as plans for hosting learning circles and gatherings where you can connect with one another and exchange wisdom between your campaigns and organizing experiences. Of course, there may be stuff that we haven't yet thought of and that's where we need your input.

Bring a friend, a cup of tea (or bev of choice) and we'll share the story of the HUB, elaborate on our offerings this fall and make space for Q&A and new ideas.
