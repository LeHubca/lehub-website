Growing our movements to win requires effective recruitment and retention strategies. While every campaign is unique, grounding in principles of authentic relationship-building can help ensure we are building a strong foundation for success. Part one of this two-part workshop offers participants a solid primer in theories and frameworks for recruiting with intention and purpose as well as an understanding of the conditions that enable team members and supporters to flourish and win together.
