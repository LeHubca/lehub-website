Climate work can take a large psychological and emotional toll on organizers. It can be hard to find time to address the emotional weight of this work, but leaving it unaddressed can quickly lead to burnout. In this drop-in series, join facilitator Gabrielle Gelderman (she/her) and a small circle of your climate organizing peers to lift some of the emotional burdens of this work. Using group sharing, personal reflection, and guided meditation practices, this series asks the question: “how can we use grounding practices as a way to cope with despair and stay connected to ourselves, each other, and our shared purpose, in order to experience and work towards transformative change?"

This will be a six week, drop-in, free online series facilitated by Gabrielle Gelderman (she/her), community organizer and chaplain. Gabrielle is a third-generation settler on amiskwaciwâskahikan, Treaty 6 territory (Edmonton, Alberta). She is a student of contemplative and somatic healing traditions and provides spiritual care to people in both hospital and social movement settings. 

This series will take place Tuesdays from 4:30-6:30pm PST/7:30-9:30pm EST starting March 21st and ending on April 25th. You may express interest in one or multiple sessions (each of which has a theme, as articulated below).
