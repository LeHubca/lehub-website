How do we build effective group structures without reproducing oppressive dynamics? The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help them guide their groups towards establishing a group structure that lines up with their purpose and Theory of Change.

In this workshop, we cover the inherent tensions between most grassroots groups’ rejection of hierarchy and the need for a functional and visible decision-making flow that keeps things moving and helps avoid group burnout.
