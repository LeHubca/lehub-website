<!--StartFragment-->

This workshop leads participants through foundational concepts to using an anti-o lens in organizing; environmentalism in the context of settler colonialism, systems of oppression and intersectionality. Using these foundational concepts, participants will think through scenario-based exercises on topics including white supremacy culture, the ally-industrial complex, and the nuts and bolts of anti-o in grassroots groups. The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with foundational concepts and tools that help guide groups collaboratively towards developing anti-oppressive practices in group life.

This workshop was created because this topic was often requested by climate justice organizers. The material that makes up these slides is drawn from a collaboration between several senior movement thinkers including Amara Possian, Tom Liacas, and many other folks in the Momentum Training Community, Mobilisation Lab and Blueprints for Change.

**This workshop is free and open to all climate and social justice organizers across so-called Canada.**
