<!--StartFragment-->

This workshop leads participants through foundational concepts to using an anti-o lens in organizing; environmentalism in the context of settler colonialism, systems of oppression and intersectionality. Using these foundational concepts, participants will think through scenario-based exercises on topics including white supremacy culture, the ally-industrial complex, and the nuts and bolts of anti-o in grassroots groups. The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with foundational concepts and tools that help guide groups collaboratively towards developing anti-oppressive practices in group life.

This workshop is free for all climate justice activists across so-called Canada.
