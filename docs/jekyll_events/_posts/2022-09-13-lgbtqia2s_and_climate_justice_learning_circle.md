On Thursday, September 15th at 6:30pm EST, the HUB is hosting a bilingual online sharing circle on LGBTQIA2S+ issues and their connections to the climate crisis. Here are some prompts we will reflect on together:\
\
In what ways can LGBTQIA2S+ identities be a factor of marginalization and vulnerability in times of climate crisis?\
\
How can social struggles lead to a post-capitalism of queer liberation?\
\
How can we destroy the binary and colonial conception of nature that is often at the root of oppression?\
\
What makes a group welcoming to LGBTQIA2S+ people?\
\
\*We wish to open this space for LGBTQIA2S+ folks only. Thank you! \*\
