## The HUB

The Climate Justice Organizing HUB is a support structure designed around the needs of grassroots social movement organizers in so-called Canada that respects organizersâ€™ knowledge regarding their own challenges and priorities. Through responsive troubleshooting, skills and strategy sharing, and other capacity-building activities, its mission is to help organizers find their way to building a critical mass of engaged people who are working towards a just transition.

You can browse the [About](/stage-2021/en/about/) menu option to learn more about how we support organizers, how we run and who supports us, as well as our [Vision and Theory of Change](/stage-2021/en/vision/).
