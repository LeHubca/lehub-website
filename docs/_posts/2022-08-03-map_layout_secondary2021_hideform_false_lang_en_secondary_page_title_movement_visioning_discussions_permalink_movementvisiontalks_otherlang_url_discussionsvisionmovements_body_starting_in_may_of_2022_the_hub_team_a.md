Starting in May of 2022, the HUB team and friends kicked off a series of movement visioning discussions in multiple locations across so-called Canada and Québec.<br/><br/>These dialogues with climate justice organizers were kicked off by a drop of some big-picture movement ideas from HUB founder Tom Liacas with input from the HUB team as a whole, as well as HUB advisor Amara Possian, with input from a team of organizers she has been working with to “frontload” a new social movement organization to tackle the climate crisis and growing economic inequality.<br/>

<br/>City by city and region by region, we hope to keep these dialogues going to gather as many perspectives from the climate justice movement as possible and then communicate them back to you.<br/><br/>Below you will find some of the material we use to kick off local dialogues as well as accounts of what went down in different places where these talks have already happened.<br/>

### Visioning/discussion guide

We prepared this guide to help local hosts facilitate their own version of the movement visioning talk. Inside, you'll find kickoff ideas are informed by research, personal organizing experience and historical perspectives, and presented to help climate justice organizers think through where they’re at in the movement-building cycle. <br/><br/>

### Vancouver talk - July 8th

On July 8th, the HUB hosted an in-person gathering in so-called Vancouver for local climate justice organizers. As about 20 participants enjoyed a picnic-style gathering and getting to see new and old faces alike, they also engaged in a facilitated discussion about the state of the climate movement and what next steps need to be taken to scale up our impact.<br/><br/>A breakout discussion group pictured below, while respecting activist privacy of course!

### Montreal talk - May 28th

On May 28th, the HUB hosted an in-person gathering in Tiohti:áke (also known as Montréal) for a day-long event. During the event, over 50 participants had the opportunity to socialize with other local climate and social justice organizers, as well as try their hand at making silkscreen-printed t-shirts and create their own linocut prints. A table with resources on the rights of protestors and activists was also available for general access.<br/><br/>The main panel discussion of the event included members of various organizations fighting for social and environmental justice. One of the core learnings from the event was the importance of progressive organizations to organize and build together in order to construct a powerful convergence of struggles. <br/><br/>Pictured below are MC Albert Lalonde, panelists Jen Gobby, Hady Kodoye Anne, Rushdia Mehreen and moderator Tom Liacas

### Toronto talk - May 12th

On May 12th, the HUB hosted an in-person evening gathering in Tkaronto (also known as Toronto) with local climate justice organizers. After having some time to settle in and socialize, over thirty participants were invited by HUB founder Tom Liacas to take part in a facilitated discussion concerning where the climate justice movement is at now, how much more power needs to be built in order to achieve systems change, and how we can begin to build that base together.<br/><br/>Following short reflections offered by Tom on the topics mentioned above, participants broke out into facilitated discussion groups to share their insights about the current state of the climate movement and what opportunities lie ahead for building power at this moment in the movement building cycle.<br/><br/>Pictured here are some Toronto folks discussing and having fun, respecting activist privacy of course!
