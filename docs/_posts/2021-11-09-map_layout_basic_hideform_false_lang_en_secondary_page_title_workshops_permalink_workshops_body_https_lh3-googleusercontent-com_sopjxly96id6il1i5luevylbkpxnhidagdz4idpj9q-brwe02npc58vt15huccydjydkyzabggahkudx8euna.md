\
The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with frameworks and decision-making tools that help guide groups towards creating solid mobilizing and organizing strategies together.\
\
This is not just a primer on the principles of solid strategy (though it does cover that) but mostly a session for group facilitators that helps them guide their own groups towards finding a balance between the desire for collaborative decision making with the need to focus and narrow down to create powerful and viable strategies.\
\
This workshop was created because this topic was often requested by climate justice organizers. The curriculum material was drawn from a collaboration between several senior movement thinkers including [Amara Possian and Tom Liacas](https://www.lehub.ca/en/team/), and also draws on sources and wisdom from many other folks in the Momentum Training Community, Mobilisation Lab and Blueprints for Change.\

\
The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with decision-making reflections and frameworks that help them guide their groups towards establishing a group structure that lines up with the group's purpose and Theory of Change.\
\
In this workshop, we cover the inherent tensions between the rejection of hierarchy in most grassroots groups and the need for a functional and visible decision-making flow that will keep things moving and also help avoid group burnout.\

\
This workshop aims to collectively surface and explore experiences of conflict that arise in organizing spaces. Holding space for this in the format of a facilitated discussion, participants collectively generate reflections and takeaways to nurture healthier relationships with conflict in the future.\
\
Through reflecting on conflict in movement spaces and deepening our understanding of transformative justice, this workshop helps organizers align on imagining new ways of responding to conflict and harm. Importantly, practicing transformative justice approaches in response to harm aims to change the conditions in which harm was created, as opposed to punitive measures that treat harm as isolated and people as disposable.\
\
This offering centres around key thematic areas that organizers have identified as sources of conflict in ongoing conversations with HUB team members. These themes include white supremacy culture, gatekeeping and the lack of space and capacity to hold space for conflict. In exploring these themes, this workshop draws from thinkers including Tema Okun, Adrienne Maree Brown, Mia Mingus and Kai Cheng Thom.\

\
The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with foundational concepts and tools that help guide grassroots groups towards developing anti-oppressive practices in group life. These concepts and tools are offered as a starting place for a longer journey of anti-oppression and intersectionality as an ongoing practice.\
\
This workshop leads participants through foundational concepts including: environmentalism in the context of settler colonialism, systems of oppression and intersectionality. Using these foundational concepts, participants engage in scenario-based exercises on topics including white supremacy culture, the ally-industrial complex, and the nuts and bolts of anti-oppression in grassroots groups.\
\
Materials for this workshop draws on Black Feminist thought – namely Kimberlé Crenshaw’s idea of intersectionality, The Indigenous Ally Toolkit by the Montreal Indigenous Community NETWORK, as well as Indigenous Action’s zine, Accomplices Not Allies: Abolishing the Ally-Industrial Complex. \
