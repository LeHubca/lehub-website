## How we collect and use personal data

The HUB has a firm commitment to internet privacy and digital security. You can visit our website without telling us who you are. The only time we collect your personal data (your name and email address) is when you voluntarily sign up for one of our trainings or conferences on our website, at which point you are added to our Mailchimp email list so you can receive updates on the training and other opportunities the HUB is offering. At anytime, you may unsubscribe by clicking the link at the bottom of our emails. We will never share your personal data, and the only place we store it is on Mailchimp.

## How we keep your personal information safe

We want to assure you that any information we gather remains confidential and will be stored securely on end-to-end encrypted documents that will not be made public. Your identity, as well as that of the group, will always be kept secured and not shared with anyone without your consent.

We may gather together a series of anonymized trends regarding the needs of grassroots groups to share with funders and other nonprofit organizations that support climate justice but your names or your group names will never be associated with data in any reporting without your consent.

Our security measures include using end-to-end encrypted platforms with trusted digital security practices to communicate and store information. Access toÂ information is limited to only those who have an organizational need to know. Two-factor authentification is required for all of our Mailchimp list admins. HUB staff are briefed on digital security and their responsibilities to safeguard personal data.
