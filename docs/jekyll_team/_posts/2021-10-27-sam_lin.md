bio_en: Sam Lin (she/her) is a youth climate justice activist currently
  attending Queenâ€™s University, on the unceded Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee
  territories.  After her initial introduction to environmental action, she
  noticed a lack of dialogue about the intersections of social issues and
  climate change. Since then, she has organized with youth-led groups such as
  Sustainabiliteens, Climate Strike Canada, and Banking on a Better Future, with
  an emphasis on tackling the climate crisis, mobilizing communities, and
  building a more just, equitable future for all.
